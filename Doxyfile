# Doxyfile 1.10.0

# Configuration for Doxygen for use with CMake.
# Only options that deviate from the default are included.
# To create a new Doxyfile containing all available options, call `doxygen -g`.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "MTspin-mcu-firmware"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = v$(CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION).$(CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION).$(CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION)

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = images/mtspin red and white 200 x 46 png transparent.png

# With the PROJECT_ICON tag one can specify an icon that is included in the tabs
# when the HTML document is shown. Doxygen will copy the logo to the output
# directory.

PROJECT_ICON           = images/mt red 98 x 98 png black background.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = $(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)/docs

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = src README.md SYSTEMUML.md

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = images

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading style
# sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to fine-tune the look of
# the HTML output. If left blank doxygen will generate a default style sheet.
# See also section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the style
# sheet that doxygen normally uses.
# Note: It is recommended to use HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET instead of this tag, as
# it is more robust and this tag (HTML_STYLESHEET) will in the future become
# obsolete.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_STYLESHEET        = $(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)/_deps/doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to diagram generator tools
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# https://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate inheritance and
# collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling
# Language.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

UML_LOOK               = YES

# When using plantuml, the PLANTUML_JAR_PATH tag should be used to specify the
# path where java can find the plantuml.jar file or to the filename of jar file
# to be used. If left blank, it is assumed PlantUML is not used or called during
# a preprocessing step. Doxygen will generate a warning when it encounters a
# \startuml command in this case and will not generate output for the diagram.

PLANTUML_JAR_PATH      = $(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)/_deps
